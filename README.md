boowomp, this random game added a captcha for chatting, so i bypassed it, they use chatgpt to make questions, i use chatgpt to solve ;)

```
getgenv().config = {
    apiKey = "", -- put your api key here, you can make new chatgpt accounts and get free credit.
    model = "gpt-4o-mini" -- dont change model
}
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myethg/botting/refs/heads/main/botting.lua"))()
```
